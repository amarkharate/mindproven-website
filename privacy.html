        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="date">Last updated: December 31, 2024</p>
        
        <p>Manifest ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.</p>
        
        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>Manifest is designed with privacy in mind. We collect minimal information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User Preferences:</strong> Your selected categories, goals, and app settings are stored locally on your device.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Basic app usage statistics (such as affirmations viewed, streaks) are stored locally on your device.</li>
            <li><strong>Subscription Status:</strong> If you subscribe to Manifest: Daily Affirmations Premium, Apple handles all payment processing. We only receive confirmation of your subscription status.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>How We Store Your Data</h2>
        <p>All your personal data (preferences, favorites, progress) is stored locally on your device using iOS's built-in storage. We do not transmit your personal data to external servers.</p>
        
        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We use the following third-party services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Apple StoreKit:</strong> For processing in-app purchases and subscriptions. Apple's privacy policy applies to payment processing.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or share your personal information with third parties. Your data stays on your device.</p>
        
        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You can delete all your data at any time by uninstalling the app. Since data is stored locally, removing the app removes all associated data.</p>
        
        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in the app.</p>
